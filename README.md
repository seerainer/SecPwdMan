## Features
- **Encryption:** AES/GCM (256-bit) or ChaCha20-Poly1305 (256-bit)
- **Envelope Encryption:** OWASP-recommended two-key hierarchy — a random Data Encryption Key (DEK) encrypts vault data; a Key Encryption Key (KEK) derived from the master password wraps the DEK; changing the master password only re-wraps the DEK without re-encrypting vault data
- **Key Derivation:** Argon2 (recommended), scrypt or PBKDF2
- **Password Strength Measurement:** Integrated zxcvbn4j
- **Random Password Generator:** Customizable, supports custom characters
- **Automatic Lock:** Locks after inactivity
- **Deflate Compression:** For password file storage
- **Secure File Deletion:** Shreds exported files
- **Screenshot Protection:** Prevents screen capture on Windows
- **Cross-Platform:** Linux, Mac, Windows
- **Modern UI:** Built with Eclipse SWT
- **Import/Export:** CSV support
- **Configurable Table & Dialog Fonts**
- **Theming:** Dark mode
- **Unit & Integration Tests:** Comprehensive test coverage
- **Secure Native Memory:** Sensitive operations use off-heap native memory (Java Foreign Memory API) via `SecureMemory` with explicit zeroing; unavoidable on-heap copies are minimized and cleared as quickly as possible.

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Java 25** (GraalVM recommended for native image)
- **Gradle 8.14+**
- **Git**

### Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/seerainer/SecPwdMan.git
cd SecPwdMan
```

### Build & Run
```sh
./gradlew build
./gradlew run
```

#### Native Image (GraalVM)
```sh
./gradlew nativeCompile
./build/native/nativeCompile/SecPwdMan
```

---

## Usage

### Start the Application
```sh
./gradlew run
```

### Main Features
- Add, edit and delete password entries
- Organize passwords in groups
- Generate strong random passwords
- Import/export as CSV
- Change master password and key derivation settings
- Lock/unlock the application

### Command-Line Arguments
- You can pass a password file as an argument to open it directly:
  ```sh
  ./gradlew run --args='my-passwords.json'
  ```

---

## Configuration
- All configuration and log files are stored in your home directory
- Settings include:
  - Key derivation function (Argon2, scrypt, PBKDF2)
  - Encryption algorithm (AES, ChaCha20)
  - Auto-lock timeout
  - Table and dialog font
  - Window size and position

---

## Security
- **Envelope Encryption:** Follows the [OWASP Cryptographic Storage Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cryptographic_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#encrypting-stored-keys) — a random 256-bit Data Encryption Key (DEK) encrypts vault data; a Key Encryption Key (KEK) derived from the master password via KDF wraps the DEK; only the encrypted DEK is stored in the vault file, never the KEK
- **Encryption:** AES-256-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305 for vault data; AES-256-GCM always used for the DEK wrapping layer; v1 vaults bind cipher/KDF metadata as AEAD associated data so tampering fails authentication
- **Key Derivation:** Argon2, scrypt, or PBKDF2 for KEK derivation from the master password
- **SecureRandom:** Cryptographically secure random number generation (`SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`)
- **Secure Native Memory:** Sensitive crypto operations use off-heap native memory where practical via the Foreign Memory API, with explicit wiping; some JVM-managed heap copies are unavoidable and are cleared promptly
- **Screenshot Protection:** Prevents screen capture on Windows
- **Secure File Deletion:** Shreds exported files to prevent recovery
- **Password Strength:** Integrated zxcvbn4j for strength feedback
- **No Cloud Storage:** All data is local; no remote sync

---

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Run with: `./gradlew unitTest`
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Run with: `./gradlew integrationTest`
- **All Tests:**
  - Run with: `./gradlew allTests`
- **Test Reports:**
  - See `build/reports/tests/`
